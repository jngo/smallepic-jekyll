  <h1><em>2019–</em><br>I’m currently democratising access to geospatial data and analytics at <a href="https://up42.com/">UP42</a>.</h1>
  <p>As the first design hire within the Airbus Defence and Space subsidiary, I have established design practice within the organisation.</p>
  <p>As the first design hire within the Airbus Defence and Space subsidiary, I drive our design process from discovery, to exploration and prototyping, through to implementation.</p>
  <p>I’ve been responsible for establishing a culture of continuous research through a combination of quantitative (SQL, BigQuery, etc.) and qualitative (user interviews, usability testing, etc.) techniques—to ensure decisions are made with the best data and insights at hand.</p>
  <p>I also drive our user centred design process from discovery to exploration and prototyping, through to implementation; as well as collaborating with our frontend team to establish the foundations of our design system, through the design and implementation of token and component libraries in Figma and Vue.js.</p>

  <h2>Highlights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Catalog Search</strong><br>A technically ambitious project to provide real-time visibility into available satellite imagery from multiple providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Geospatial Solutions Marketplace</strong><br>Informed leadership decision making through facilitation of a design sprint exploring the opportunities for a lucrative, yet potentially high risk venture into a new market.</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing Website</strong><br>A holistic redesign of the marketing website driven by a research led understanding of customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Research Master Plan</strong><br>Working closely with sales, marketing, and business intelligence to implement a research stack for gathering, aggregating, and disseminating customer research and insights.</li>

  <h1><em>2017–2019</em><br>Prior to that, I was helping businesses automate their bookkeeping and accounting at <a href="https://www.candis.io/">Candis</a>.</h1>
  <p>As a single person design team, I was responsible for user experience across the portfolio of products at Candis. Practically speaking, I conducted user research, produced design concepts and prototypes, documented epics and user stories, and contributed UI enhancements to the frontend codebase.</p>
  <p>I also led the initiative to scale design to meet the needs of a growing engineering team through the development of a design system that served as the style guide and component library for current and future Candis products.</p>

  <h1><em>2015</em><br>I also helped people discover sports venues and achieve their fitness goals at <a href="https://urbansportsclub.com/">Urban Sports Club</a>.</h1>
  <p>At a crucial inflexion point in the service, I implemented key technical infrastructure including source control and continuous integration to support the startup’s ambitious plans for rapid growth and international expansion.</p>
  <p>My key achievement was leading the delivery team tasked with building the platform’s API, iOS, and Android checkin apps replacing the existing manual membership card and log sheet processes; where I designed the Restful API specification and mobile app experiences.</p>
